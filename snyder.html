        Zack Snyder’s Justice League is the original version of Justice League as written by Chris Terrio and Zack Snyder. Despite being rewritten and reshot, Snyder completed principal photography and significant post-production, meaning minimal work is needed to realize his original vision.

        Timeline of events
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>May 2017</strong> - Zack Snder leaves 'Justice League' in the aftermath of a terrible family tragedy. Joss Whedon was brought in to complete the project in time. So you see that's where the trouble began.</li>
        <br><li><strong>June 2017</strong> - Danny Elfman replaces Junkie XL as the film's composer.</li>
        <br><li><strong>Nov 2017</strong> - The film is released and is a box office disappointment. Angry DC fans began to rally around the "Snyder Cut" as the one true version of Justice League. Just over a week after the film's release, an online petition for a release of the "Snyder Cut" amassed more than 130,000 signatures.</li>
        <br><li><strong>Jan 2018</strong> - New details suggest the 'Snyder Cut' is more complete than previously believed. According to Screen Rant's Stephen M. Colbert, Snyder's cut of the film was in "picture lock," meaning a rough cut had been assembled and edited, was undergoing color grading, had several completed visual effects, and was beginning the process of audio mixing. If fans weren't already holding out hope for an official "Snyder Cut" release, they certainly were now.</li>
        <br><li><strong>Early 2018</strong> - Zack Snyder begins releasing images and storyboards for deleted scenes. Some of these include the expected shots, like Ray Fisher in his motion capture get-up for Cyborg; others, however, have no correlation to released footage, and show glimpses of scenes and even characters not featured in the film - such as megavillain Darkseid.</li>
        <br><li><strong>Feb 2018</strong> - A veteran entertainment reporter Josh Dickey tweeted out that Warner Bros. fired Snyder - not just from Justice League but the entire DCEU. Around the same time, Matt Goldberg of Collider stated that he'd heard separate sources confirm Dickey's claim, and had heard more than one source call Snyder's version of Justice League "unwatchable."</li>
        <br><li><strong>July 2018</strong> - Ben Fritz, a senior Warner Bros. executive claimed the studio had no plans to release any alternative cuts of Justice League to the public. Fritz also reported that Snyder says he has not seen the theatrical cut of the film.</li>
        <br><li><strong>Jan 2019</strong> - "Snyder Cut" superfan Fiona Zheng had created ForSnyderCut.com in support of the unreleased version of the movie. </li>
        <br><li><strong>Mar 2019</strong> - Snyder started to speak publicly about his own cut of Justice League, saying that his version does actually exist and that it is apparently a whopping 214 minutes long. Considering the running time of the theatrical release is just two hours, and the fact that Whedon wrote and filmed extensive reshoots, there seems to be a lot of content that was left on the cutting room floor.</li>
        <br><li><strong>Apr 2019</strong> - Fans Start 'Project Comic-Con'highlighting just how passionate the "Snyder Cut" fans are, and just how far they will go to see an official release of that version of Justice League, two fans Bill Rowlands and Alessandro Maniscalco ended up raising over $26,000 for the project, half of which was donated to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention in honor of the Snyders.</li> 
        <br><li><strong>Aug 2019</strong> - Jason Momoa of Aquaman and Game of Thrones fame put up an Instagram post that included a video of him with Zack Snyder. In the post, Momoa writes, "The Snyder cut is ssssiiicccckkkkkk #luckymesucksforu," which only further confirms its existence. During the same month, Kevin Smith also claimed the "Snyder Cut" exists and the studio should consider releasing it. Smith's exact words were, "I’ve spoken now to enough people at various levels in that production. There is a Snyder cut. For sure. That's not a mythical beast. It exists."</li>
        <br><li><strong>Oct 2019</strong> - Fans pay to put up a digital billboard in times square to release the cut. Also in the same month, Antonius Holkenborg aka Junkie XL told Screen Rant that he had actually completed his original score for Justice League before he was let go and replaced by Danny Elfman. As any film geek knows, a score is immensely important to any version of a film and Holkenborg's certainly has to be a crucial element of the "Snyder Cut." When asked if fans would ever get to hear his Justice League score, Holkenborg replied, "I have no comment on that. But I'm just saying, it's there. The full tracks." </li>
        <br><li><strong>Nov 2019</strong> - After two years of silence, more members of the Justice League decided to join the fray. On November 17 - the anniversary of the release date of Justice League - Gal Gadot came out in support of the "Snyder Cut," tweeting out a photo of herself with the popular hashtag #ReleaseTheSnyderCut. Ray Fisher, who played Cyborg, also tweeted out the hashtag, as did Ben Affleck a few hours later. Yet perhaps the most interesting tweet appeared a day later, when Diane Nelson, the former head of DC Entertainment, decided to throw in her two cents. "If Zack feels he had the time and resources to finish a cut to his satisfaction and he would like fans to see it, nothing would make me happier than for him to have that opportunity," she wrote. Each of these tweets just stoked the fires of the fandom, amassing thousands and thousands of likes and retweets.</li>
        <br><li><strong>Dec 2019</strong> - Snyder himself seemed to end all speculation on the question of the cut's existence with a social media post on December 4, 2019. The director posted a photo of canned film reels on his Vero with the caption, "Is it real? Does it exist? Of course it does." The cans read "JL: Director's Cut" and "Running Time: 214." Snyder rounded out the month by sending out multiple behind-the-scenes Justice League photos on his Vero page, including one image of Henry Cavill's Superman with a caption that reads, "Drink from the chalice and be reborn."</li>
